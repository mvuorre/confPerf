# Confidence in mathematics data and analyses

Matti Vuorre <mv2521@columbia.edu>

Data and analyses discussed in Vuorre & Metcalfe (working title: "Confidence in mathematics"; in prep). 

* Data from all six experiments are in a single table at `data/merged.csv`
* Analyses are documented as an [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) ([Radix](https://rstudio.github.io/radix/)) website at `docs/index.html`, which can be viewed at <https://mvuorre.github.io/mathPerfConf>
* The materials are archived on OSF at <https://osf.io/np3cu/>, and github at <https://github.com/mvuorre/mathPerfConf>

# Reproduce

To reproduce these analyses, copy all files to a local drive. Activate the `mathPerfConf` R Project in R Studio, and run `build.R`. The analysis code is contained in `.Rmd` R Markdown files, which can also be executed individually in interactive mode.
